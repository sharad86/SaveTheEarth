Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark is a character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name and known commonly by his alter ego, Iron Man. In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of powered exoskeleton suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world. Tony doesnâ€™t give up. He built a flying suit of armor using scrapes in a cave, he synthesized a new element when he was on the verge of death, he went head-to-head with a super soldier with nothing but a gauntlet/watch device.Tony is one of the most base level heroes in MCU and yet he still runs head on into some of the most dangerous situations to help people. I mean, he faced down Loki without his suit.Tony has about average physical strength, but his intelligence allows him to accomplish things that should, by all rights, be impossible. He is able to be on an equal playing field with people like Thor, Hulk, and Captain America because he continues to adapt and gain more knowledge.we all love him 3000.
